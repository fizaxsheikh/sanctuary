# sanctuary

At **Sanctuary**, we’re not just building an app—we’re creating a movement. A movement where women, transwomen, and non-binary folks don’t have to text “home safe” out of fear. A world where we look out for each other, where safety isn’t a privilege locked behind a paywall, and where technology is used to **protect, not exploit**.

We’ve all been there—that uneasy walk home, the subtle shift of keys between fingers, the fake phone call to shake off unwanted attention. Sanctuary exists because **we shouldn’t have to live like that**.
